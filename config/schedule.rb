# It's helpful, but not entirely necessary to understand cron before proceeding.

# Example:
#
# set :output, "/path/to/my/cron_log.log"
#
# every 2.hours do
#   command "/usr/bin/some_great_command"
#   runner "MyModel.some_method"
#   rake "some:great:rake:task"
# end
#
# every 4.days do
#   runner "AnotherModel.prune_old_records"

# Sync outdated profiles once every 30min
# Note: This will not hit the Lodestone once for every character once every
# 30min - only chars that haven't been updated in a certain time will be synced
every 30.minutes do
  runner 'QueueSyncsJob.perform_later'
end
